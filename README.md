# Caching Proxy Server
> Minimalisting caching proxy server.

## Purpose
Speed-up ‚è©: the process of requests by caching üóÑÔ∏è their results on a proxy server.

## Usage
### Start the server üöÄ:
Start the caching proxy server by running a command like following:
```bash
caching-proxy --port <number> --origin <url>
```
- `--port` is the port on which the caching proxy server will run.
- `--origin` is the URL of the server to which the requests will be forwarded.
For example, if you run the following command:
```bash
caching-proxy --port 3000 --origin http://dummyjson.com
```
The caching proxy server will start on port 3000 and forward requests to http://dummyjson.com.

Taking the above example, if you make a request to http://localhost:3000/products, the caching proxy server will forward the request to http://dummyjson.com/products, return the response along with headers and cache the response. 
#### Response üìé:
In order to clarify from where the response is set, the response has a `X-Cache` header.
- If `X-Cache : HIT` - the response was found in the cache and sent form the proxy server.
- If `X-Cache: MISS` - the response was not found in the cache and fetched from the original server.

### Clear the cache :
```bash
caching-proxy --clear-cache
```
